# NetDaemon V2 (Deprecated)

This version is deprecated!

As of june 30 this add-on is not maintained. We strongly suggest moving to version 3.1 of the NetDaemon runtime.  [Please checkout de docs for how to migrate your V2 projects to V3](https://netdaemon.xyz)

From january the add-on itself will be deprecated and only available in using HA advanced mode. You can still install it and use it. After june 30 you are using it at own risk since it will not get any updates including security update.

Thanks for understanding that the development team does not have the resources to maintain multiple versions.
